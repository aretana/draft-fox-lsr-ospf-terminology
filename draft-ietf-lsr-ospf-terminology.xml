      <name>Update to RFC2328</name>
      <t>
        The base OSPFv2 specification <xref target="RFC2328"/> defines the synchronization of databases as two routers froming a "master/slave relationship".  All instances of these terms are replaced by leader/follower, respectively.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Master (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the Leader (L) bit.
      </t>
      <t>
        The operation of OSPFv2 is not modified. The Leader/Follower terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition
        changes impact the following sections:  7.2 "The Synchronization of Databases", 10 "The Neighbor Data Structures",
        10.1 "Neighbor states", 10.2 "Events causing neighbor state changes", 10.6 "Receiving Database Description Packets",
        10.8 "Sending Database Description Packets", 10.10 "An Example", and A.3.3 "The Database Description packet".

      <name>Update to RFC5340</name>
      <t>
        The base OSPFv3 specification <xref target="RFC5340"/> defines the database description process
        between two routers as one being "designated to be the master and the other is the slave".  All instances of these
        terms are replaced by leader/follower, respectively.
      </t>
      <t>
	The Master/Slave (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the Leader (L) bit.
      </t>
      <t>
        The operation of OSPFv3 is not modified. The Leader/Follower terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition

        This Best Current Practice (BCP) document describes "Prioritized Treatment of Specific OSPF Version 2 Packets and
        Congestion Avoidance" <xref target="RFC4222"/>. There is an example OSFPv2 packet sequence in Appendix C, (2),

        Section 2.4 includes a Database Description packet figure and a description of the attendant encoding
        changes for Out-of-Band Resynchronization. In the figure and the description, all instances of MS when
        referring the Database Description packet bit are renamed to "L". There is also a reference to "Master" in
        this section that is renamed to "Leader".

        This Informational document describes an "OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization" <xref target="RFC5243"/>.
        The Introduction, Section 1, references "Master or Slave". This will be replaced by "Leader or Follower".
        Section 3.0 includes an example of the optimized database exchange. In this example, all instances of
        "Master" will be renamed to "Leader" and all instances of "Slave" will be rename to "Follower".

        "Changes to the Neighbor State Machine", Section 7.2 contains modifications to the neighbor
        state machine updated from <xref target="RFC2328"/>. In this transition to "2-way" state, all
        instances of "Master" are renamed to "Leader" and all instances of "Slave" are renamed to
        "Follower". Addiitionally, instances of "MS" in reference to the Database Description packet
        bit are renamed to "L". Additionally, in "Receiving Database Description Packets, Section 7.5,
        the parenthentical "master or slave" is replaced by "leader or follower".

    <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->

    <!-- Change Log

v00 2006-03-15  EBD   Initial version

v01 2006-04-03  EBD   Moved PI location back to position 1 -
                     v3.1 of XMLmind is better with them at this location.
v02 2007-03-07  AH    removed extraneous nested_list attribute,
                     other minor corrections
v03 2007-03-09  EBD   Added comments on null IANA sections and fixed heading capitalization.
                     Modified comments around figure to reflect non-implementation of
                     figure indent control.  Put in reference using anchor="DOMINATION".
                     Fixed up the date specification comments to reflect current truth.
v04 2007-03-09 AH     Major changes: shortened discussion of PIs,
                     added discussion of rfc include.
v05 2007-03-10 EBD    Added preamble to C program example to tell about ABNF and alternative
                     images. Removed meta-characters from comments (causes problems).

v06 2010-04-01 TT     Changed ipr attribute values to latest ones. Changed date to
                     year only, to be consistent with the comments. Updated the
                     IANA guidelines reference from the I-D to the finished RFC.
v07 2020-01-21 HL    Converted the template to use XML schema version 3.
