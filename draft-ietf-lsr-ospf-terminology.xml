        This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with inclusive language used in the industry.
        The IETF has designated US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) "Guidance for NIST Staff on Using
        Inclusive Language in Documentary Standards" for its inclusive language guidelines. It is intended that all
        future OSPF documents use this revised terminology even when they reference the RFCs updated by this
        document.

      <t>
        The base OSPFv2 specification <xref target="RFC2328"/> defines the synchronization of
        databases as two routers forming a "master/slave relationship".  All instances of these terms
        are replaced by Leader/Follower, respectively.

	The Master (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the Leader (L) bit.

        The operation of OSPFv2 is not modified. The Leader/Follower terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition
        changes impact the following sections:  7.2 "The Synchronization of Databases", 10 "The Neighbor Data Structures",
        10.1 "Neighbor states", 10.2 "Events causing neighbor state changes", 10.3 "The Neighbor state machine",

      <name>Update to RFC5340</name>
      <t>
        The base OSPFv3 specification <xref target="RFC5340"/> defines the database description process
        between two routers as one being "designated to be the master and the other is the slave".  All instances of these
        terms are replaced by Leader/Follower, respectively.

      <t>
	The Master/Slave (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the Leader (L) bit.

        This Best Current Practice (BCP) document describes "Prioritized Treatment of Specific OSPF Version 2 Packets and
        Congestion Avoidance" <xref target="RFC4222"/>. There is an example OSFPv2 packet sequence in Appendix C, (2),
        that refers to the "slave" in a database exchange. This reference will be renamed to "Follower".

        Section 2.4 includes a Database Description packet (Figure 2) and a description of the attendant encoding
        changes for Out-of-Band Resynchronization. In the figure and the description, all instances of MS when
        referring to the Database Description packet bit are renamed to "L". There is also a reference to "Master" in
        this section that is renamed to "Leader".

        This Informational document describes an "OSPF Database Exchange Summary List Optimization" <xref target="RFC5243"/>.
        The Introduction, Section 1, references "Master or Slave". This will be replaced by "Leader or Follower".
        Section 3.0 includes an example of the optimized database exchange. In this example, all instances of

        "Changes to the Neighbor State Machine", Section 7.2 contains modifications to the neighbor
        state machine updated from <xref target="RFC2328"/>. In this transition to "2-way" state, all
        instances of "Master" are renamed to "Leader" and all instances of "Slave" are renamed to
        "Follower". Additionally, instances of "MS" in reference to the Database Description packet
        bit are renamed to "L". Additionally, in "Receiving Database Description Packets, Section 7.5,
        the parenthentical "master or slave" is replaced by "Leader or Follower".

        Specification for Non-IPv6 AFs", Section 2.7 contains a Database Description

        be renamed to "L" field.

            <t>
        Additionally, in Section 2.4.,first paragraph, "Changes to the Hello Packet Processing",
        the text is updated to remove the non-inclusive terms pertaining to
        unreachability handling as follows:
      </t>

 <artwork>
   When an OSPFv3 router does not support this specification and an
   interface is configured with the Instance ID corresponding to a
   IPv4 AF, packets could be routed toward this interface and
   dropped. This could happen due to misconfiguration or a router
   software downgrade. Packet reception and dropping on an interface
   not configured with the packet AF. For example, an IPv4 packet
   could be received on an interface not supporting IPv4 since
   a router that doesn't support this specification can still
   include the interface in an SPF-calculated path as long as it
   establishes adjacencies using the Instance ID corresponding
   to the IPv4 AF. Note that OSPPFv3 Router-LSAs and Network-LSAs are
   AF-agnostic.
