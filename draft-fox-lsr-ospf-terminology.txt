1.  Introduction

   This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with
   inclusive language used in the industry.

   This document updates [RFC2328].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Update to RFC2328

   The base OSPF specification [RFC2328] defines the synchronization of
   databases as two routers froming a "master/slave relationship".  All
   instances of these terms are replaced by leader/follower,
   respectively.

   The Master (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the
   Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPF is not modified.

3.  Acknowledgements

   TDB

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document updates the terminology used in OSPF [RFC2328] without
   any modification to the specification of the protocol.  As such, the
   security characteristics of OSPF do not change.
