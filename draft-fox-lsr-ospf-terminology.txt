1.  Introduction

   This document updates some OSPF terminology to be in line with
   inclusive language used in the industry.

   This document updates [RFC2328] and [RFC5340].

2.  Update to RFC2328

   The base OSPFv2 specification [RFC2328] defines the synchronization
   of databases as two routers froming a "master/slave relationship".
   All instances of these terms are replaced by leader/follower,
   respectively.

   The Master (MS) bit in the database description packet is renamed the
   Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPFv2 is not modified.  The Leader/Follower
   terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition changes impact the
   following sections: 7.2 "The Synchronization of Databases", 10 "The
   Neighbor Data Structures", 10.1 "Neighbor states", 10.2 "Events
   causing neighbor state changes", 10.6 "Receiving Database Description
   Packets", 10.8 "Sending Database Description Packets", 10.10 "An
   Example", and A.3.3 "The Database Description packet".

3.  Update to RFC5340

   The base OSPFv3 specification [RFC5340] defines the database
   description process between two routers as one being "designated to
   be the master and the other is the slave".  All instances of these
   terms are replaced by leader/follower, respectively.

   The Master/Slave (MS) bit in the database description packet is
   renamed the Leader (L) bit.

   The operation of OSPFv3 is not modified.  The Leader/Follower
   terminology and Leader (L) Bit definition changes impact section
   A.3.3 "The Database Description packet".

4.  Update to RFC4222

   This Best Current Practice (BCP) document describes "Prioritized
   Treatment of Specific OSPF Version 2 Packets and Congestion
   Avoidance" [RFC4222].  There is an example OSFPv2 packet sequence in
   Appendix C, (2), that refers to the "slave" in a database exchange.
   This reference will be renamed to "follower".

5.  Update to RFC4811

   This Experimental document specifies "OSPF Out-of-Band Link State
   Database (LSDB) Resynchronization" [RFC4811].  Section 2.4 includes a
   Database Description packet figure and a description of the attendant
   encoding changes for Out-of-Band Resynchronization.  In the figure
   and the description, all instances of MS when referring the Database
   Description packet bit are renamed to "L".  There is also a reference
   to "Master" in this section that is renamed to "Leader".

6.  Update to RFC5243

   This Informational document describes an "OSPF Database Exchange
   Summary List Optimization" [RFC5243].  The Introduction, Section 1,
   references "Master or Slave".  This will be replaced by "Leader or
   Follower".  Section 3.0 includes an example of the optimized database
   exchange.  In this example, all instances of "Master" will be renamed
   to "Leader" and all instances of "Slave" will be rename to
   "Follower".

7.  Update to RFC5614

   This Experimental document specifies the "Mobile Ad Hoc Network
   (MANET) Extension of OSPF Using Connected Dominating Set (CDS)
   Flooding" [RFC5614].  "Changes to the Neighbor State Machine",
   Section 7.2 contains modifications to the neighbor state machine
   updated from [RFC2328].  In this transition to "2-way" state, all
   instances of "Master" are renamed to "Leader" and all instances of
   "Slave" are renamed to "Follower".  Addiitionally, instances of "MS"
   in reference to the Database Description packet bit are renamed to
   "L".  Additionally, in "Receiving Database Description Packets,
   Section 7.5, the parenthentical "master or slave" is replaced by
   "leader or follower".

8.  Update to RFC5838

   This Standards Track document specifies the "Support of Address
   Families in OSPFv3" [RFC5838].  "Database Description Maximum
   Transmission Unit (MTU) Specification for Non-IPv6 AFs", Section 2.7
   contains a Database Description packet change figure which include
   the "MS" bit.  In this figure, the "MS" field will be renamed to "L"
   field.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to rename bit 0x01 in the "Database Description
   (DD) Packet Flags" registry to "Leader (L-bit)" and to add a
   reference to this document.

11.  Security Considerations

   This document updates the terminology used in OSPF RFCs without any
   modification to the specifications of the protocol.  As such, the
   security characteristics of OSPF do not change.
